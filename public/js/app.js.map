Es liegt in Ihrer Verantwortung, Ihr Gerät und den Zugriff auf die App bzw. Webseite sicher zu halten. Ich empfehle Ihnen daher, Ihr Telefon nicht Verfahren wie „Jailbreak“ oder „Root“ zu unterziehen, da dies der Prozess der Beseitigung von Software-Beschränkungen und -Einschränkungen ist, die durch das offizielle Betriebssystem Ihres Geräts auferlegt werden. Es könnte Ihr Gerät anfällig für Malware/Viren/Bösartige Programme machen, die Sicherheitsfunktionen Ihres Telefons beeinträchtigen und dazu führen, dass die Mein Moers App nicht richtig oder überhaupt nicht funktioniert.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"mt-2\">\n                Sie sollten sich bewusst sein, dass es bestimmte Dinge gibt, für die Lennart Fischer keine Verantwortung übernimmt. Bestimmte Funktionen der App erfordern eine aktive Internetverbindung. Die Verbindung kann Wi-Fi sein oder von Ihrem Mobilfunkanbieter bereitgestellt werden, aber Lennart Fischer kann keine Verantwortung dafür übernehmen, dass die Anwendung nicht mit voller Funktionalität funktioniert, wenn Sie keinen Zugang zu Wi-Fi haben und Sie keine Daten mehr haben.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"mt-2\">\n                Wenn Sie die App außerhalb eines Bereichs mit Wi-Fi nutzen, sollten Sie daran denken, dass die Bedingungen der Vereinbarung mit Ihrem Mobilfunkanbieter weiterhin gelten. Dies kann dazu führen, dass Ihnen von Ihrem Mobilfunkanbieter die Kosten für die Dauer der Verbindung während des Zugriffs auf die App oder andere Gebühren Dritter in Rechnung gestellt werden. Mit der Nutzung der App übernehmen Sie die Verantwortung für solche Gebühren, einschließlich Roaming-Datengebühren, wenn Sie die App außerhalb Ihres Heimatlandes (d.h. Region oder Land) nutzen, ohne das Datenroaming abzuschalten. Wenn Sie nicht der Rechnungszahler für das Gerät sind, auf dem Sie die App nutzen, beachten Sie bitte, dass ich davon ausgehe, dass Sie die Erlaubnis des Rechnungszahlers zur Nutzung der App erhalten haben.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"mt-2\">\n                In diesem Sinne kann Lennart Fischer nicht immer die Verantwortung für die Art und Weise übernehmen, wie Sie die App nutzen, d.h. Sie müssen sicherstellen, dass Ihr Gerät geladen bleibt - wenn der Akku leer ist und Sie es nicht einschalten können, um den Service in Anspruch zu nehmen, kann Lennart Fischer keine Verantwortung übernehmen.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"mt-2\">\n                Im Hinblick auf die Zuständigkeit von Lennart Fischer für Ihre Nutzung der App ist es wichtig zu bedenken, dass ich mich zwar bemühe, diese jederzeit zu aktualisieren und zu korrigieren, uns aber auf Informationen Dritter verlassen, damit ich sie Ihnen zur Verfügung stellen können.

Die App ist derzeit auf iOS und im Web verfügbar - die Anforderungen für beide Systeme (und für alle weiteren Systeme, auf die ich die Verfügbarkeit der App erweitern möchte) können sich ändern, und Sie müssen die Updates herunterladen, wenn Sie die App weiterhin verwenden möchten. Lennart Fischer verspricht nicht, die App immer so zu aktualisieren, dass sie für Sie relevant ist und/oder mit der iOS-Version, die Sie auf Ihrem Gerät installiert haben, funktioniert. Ich kann auch die Bereitstellung der Anwendung einstellen und die Nutzung der Anwendung jederzeit ohne Kündigung beenden. Sofern ich Ihnen nichts anderes mitteile, enden (a) die Ihnen in diesen Bedingungen gewährten Rechte und Lizenzen; (b) Sie müssen die Nutzung der App einstellen und (falls erforderlich) sie von Ihrem Gerät löschen.\n            </p>\n\n            <h2 class=\"my-4 font-semibold text-2xl\">Änderungen dieser Geschäftsbedingungen</h2>\n\n            Ich kann die Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen von Zeit zu Zeit aktualisieren.
